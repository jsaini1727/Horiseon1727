# Horiseon - Digital Marketing Solutions

## Description
```
In this project we refactored code that was given to us.  We went through the HTML and replaced all the
"div's" with the correct semantic tags.  We then went through and refactored the CSS file included.
We consolidated the css and made sure it was using proper structure and naming.
